## üöÄ Pleased to Meet You! I'm **Pongsak D** (Since the '90s) üëã

I am a **Web Developer** who has witnessed the internet's evolution since the days of reliance on **HTML, CGI/Perl**, and **Table Layouts** (Web 1.0 era), right up to the present complexity of **Full-Stack Frameworks**.

I believe in the importance of building robust and efficient websites, blending classic experience with modern trends, both in diverse development (Full-Stack) and ensuring easy web access (SEO & Performance). **Currently, I focus on utilizing AI (Generative AI/Co-pilot) to accelerate project creation and boost operational efficiency.**

### üå± Development Philosophy: The Controller of Technology

* **AI-Augmented Development:** I've shifted from writing every line of code myself to becoming the **"Conductor,"** utilizing AI Tools (like GitHub Copilot, Code Llama) to accelerate the speed and quality of coding.
* **Performance First:** A good website must load fast, whether you're using **Dial-up** or **Fiber Optic**.
* **Flexibility:** Capable of working from setting up **Apache/Nginx** on a server all the way to deploying **Serverless** applications.
